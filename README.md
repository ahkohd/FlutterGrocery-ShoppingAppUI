# 🍔😋 Fryo - Grocery Shopping  App template kit [![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

A Flutter UI template of a Grocery Shopping App I found on Uplabs.

Design screens are on [Uplabs.](https://www.uplabs.com/posts/grocery-shopping-full-app) It's premium, purchase it if you want to use it commercially.

> **Disclaimer:** I am not in anyway in affiliate with the designer of the screens. I just love the UI and decided to code it in Flutter😽
